  ThrottleMs: 200                       # Delay in milliseconds between Radarr API calls (helps avoid overload)

Behavior:

  PreflightSeconds: 0                   # Optional delay in seconds before the script starts doing work
  PostMoveWaitSeconds: 0                # Optional short delay after changing a movie (helps Radarr settle)

    MoveVerifyEnabled: true             # Enable verification after Radarr move operations
    MoveVerifyMode: radarr              # radarr | filesystem | both (radarr is safest when using Docker paths)

    MoveVerifyDelaySeconds: 5           # Delay before first verification attempt

# FilmEngine configuration
#
# Unlike CompleteARR's SeriesEngine, the FilmEngine does not have incomplete/complete folders.
# Instead, we enforce that each quality profile has its correct root folder.
# This ensures movies stay organized in their proper libraries.
#
# You can have as many profiles/folders as you like, and even set
# profiles to share the same roots if you want. 
# The config below is just what I use.
#
# Run Fetchinfo.ps1 to get your Quality Profile names and Root Paths
# Uncomment the FilmEngine section below and edit to match your FetchInfo results.
